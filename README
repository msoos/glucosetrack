You must build this package with cmake:

$ cmake .
$ make

You can use this program like glucose:

$ ./glucose.sh problemname.cnf

If you want to use the 'glucose_track' in standalone mode, please
don't forget to add the '-track' option. Without it, the program will
not measure usefulness.

The output contains stuff that is printed to the STDERR, which is for
your own amusement (especially the % ready part), but the tracking info
is printed to STDOUT, which you can easily capture like this:

$ ./glucose_track -track mycnf.cnf > myinserts

You then need to import 'myinserts' like this:

$ mysql -u myname -p mypass -D glucosetrack < myinserts

and then you can play around with the results as you wish. Please note
that you may need to clear the database before you import the new dataset.
To do that, issue the SQL command:

DELETE FROM data
