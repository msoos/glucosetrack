You must build this package with cmake:

$ cmake .
$ make

You can use this program like glucose:

./glucose.sh problemname.cnf

The output, however, will regularly contain learnt clause sets with
their usefulness measures

NOTE: if you want to use the 'glucose_track' in standalone mode, please
don't forget to add the '-track' option. Without it, the program will
not measure usefulness
